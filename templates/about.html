       <div class="abroad-description">
    <p>The admission process in the field of MBBS in India has undergone various changes and reforms in the past couple of years. Considering the participation it receives and the competition, which is very vast and diverse, obtaining a degree in Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) is not the easiest task, and students are often seen grasping at straws.</p>
     <p>In such dire straits, it becomes important to have a mentor, a consultant, or an advisor who can guide students and help them get the best outcome for themselves.</p>
     <strong>In India, the process of admission for the course of MBBS is done through various steps. These steps are as follows:</strong>
     <ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Throughout India, there is a single national level exam which is conducted. This is known as NEET.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">NEET is conducted under the aegis of NTA or National Testing Agency, on a year to year basis.</span></li><li>No separate state level or university level exams are conducted.</li><li>For every university, be it a private university or government-run university, the admission for the course of MBBS is done solely based on the scores received in the NEET exam.</li><li>Candidates fill in their preferential college names, at the time of filling up the NEET forms.</li><li>Colleges are then allocated to them based on their scores and their preferences.</li><li>NEET is conducted on a yearly basis that allows candidates to pursue undergraduate in the field of medicine, both in India and to <strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">study MBBS abroad</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
     <p>Since the level of competition is very high and approximately around 22 students fight for a single seat in MBBS admission in India, the second-best option they have for themselves is to&nbsp;<strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">study MBBS abroad</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The fact that there are no entry-level examinations required to make an admission other than NEET and they are also most cost-efficient, studying MBBS abroad is preferred by many.</span></p>
     <p>When one thinks about going abroad to pursue a career, they often find themselves in a lot of dilemmas. There are many questions to which they need answers. Going abroad and studying abroad requires a lot of work, documentation, and attention to detail.</p>

</div>
<div class="abroad-description">
<p>Studying abroad comes with its benefits. The pros of pursuing a career, outside one’s own country come with more benefits and advantages than what one can anticipate. Here are some of the benefits if one opts to <strong>Study MBBS in Abroad</strong> countries.</p>
<ul><li>In India, out of the total number of applicants, only 5% get to qualify for a seat in any one of the medical colleges. On top of that, the private medical colleges that constitute more than half of the total medical colleges in India, the capitation fee is very steep. For such reasons, for any middle-class family, going for a college which is situated out of India is a financially more viable option.</li><li>There are no separate entrance exams for every college outside India, in other countries. Many colleges take admission through the NEET marks, and many have a different eligibility criterion.</li><li>The living cost is relatively cheaper in many countries outside India. Studying MBBS in European countries or Asian Countries are quite viable in terms of financial dependence and the cost of daily living.</li><li>Once a youth starts living outside the comfort of their own country, they become much more independent, both mentally and financially. They start developing as a person. They get more confident in facing different paths of life. They also strengthen their decision making capability.</li></ul>
